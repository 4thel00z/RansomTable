# RansomTable
Jquery table widget for handling various data formats .

## Installation
Just paste this into your commandline after changing into your directory of preference:

cd RansomTable
npm install 
cd node_modules/jquery-ui 
npm install 
cd ../..
gulp
```

## Example

After running gulp (and successfully spawning the bundled test server on port 3000 - which in consequence has to be free)
you can browse to: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where you can consult the non-typescript jquery-ui based version.
It will be updated step by step to reflect the changes made in the type safe part.

## Development

To participate open tickets under issues and after a short review process and implementation discussion feel free to open
a pull request which reflect the given changes.
